        <strong>Commons Codec 1.8</strong> <br/><br/>
        The codec package contains simple encoder and decoders for various formats such as Base64 and 
        Hexadecimal.  In addition to these widely used encoders and decoders, the codec package also 
        maintains a collection of phonetic encoding utilities.

        <strong>JSON in Java 20131018</strong> <br/><br/>
        JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
        See http://www.JSON.org/

        The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.
        It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP
        headers, Cookies, and CDL.

        This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
        in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
        then, choose carefully.

        The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
        not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
        package.

        The package compiles on Java 1.2 thru Java 1.4.
