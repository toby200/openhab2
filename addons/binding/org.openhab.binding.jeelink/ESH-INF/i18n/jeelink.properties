parameter.baudrate.label = Baud Rate
parameter.baudrate.description = The baud rate of the USB Receiver. Valid values are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 (default), and 115200.
parameter.ipaddress.label = IP Address
parameter.ipaddress.description = The IP address of the Server to which the USB Receiver is connected.
parameter.port.label = TCP Port
parameter.port.description = The TCP port over which the serial port is made available.
parameter.sketchname.label = Sketch Name
parameter.sketchname.description = The name of the sketch that has been flashed to the USB Receiver.
parameter.initcommands.label = Init Commands
parameter.initcommands.description = Optional initialization commands (semicolon separated) that will be send after connecting, e.g. "0a v" to turn of the LED.
parameter.sensorid.label = Sensor ID
parameter.sensorid.description = The sensor ID used by this sensor.
parameter.updateinterval.label = Update Interval
parameter.updateinterval.description = The update interval in seconds (0 puts the sensor in live mode).
parameter.sensortimeout.label = Sensor Timeout
parameter.sensortimeout.description = The amount of time that should result in OFFLINE status when no readings have been received from the sensor (in seconds).
parameter.buffersize.label = Buffer Size
parameter.buffersize.description = The amount of readings that should be used to compute a rolling average (0 disables the rolling average).
parameter.mintemp.label = Lower Temperature Limit
parameter.mintemp.description = The lowest temperature allowed as valid reading from the sensor. All lower readings will be ignored.
